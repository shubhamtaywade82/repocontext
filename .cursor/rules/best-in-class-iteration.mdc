# Best-in-Class Iteration

When the user asks to make the system **best-in-class**, to **iterate until done**, or to **keep testing and improving until the system is best-in-class**:

1. **Each round:** Run the full verification suite (RuboCop if present, test suite). Fix any failure. Repeat.
2. **Do not stop** after one successful run. Only stop after **two consecutive full passes** of the verification suite.
3. **Exit** by reporting: "Best-in-class iteration complete." when the exit criteria are met.

If the user says "continue" or "keep going" after you report completion, run the verification suite again and fix any new failures, then repeat the two-pass rule.
